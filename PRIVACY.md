# Privacy at Forgetze
_Last updated: January 27, 2025_

At Forgetze, your privacy isn't just a feature — it's the foundation.  
We built this app so **your data stays with you, on your device, under your control.**

---

### 🔒 Your Data Stays Yours
- Forgetze never collects, sells, or shares your personal information.  
- We don't run ads, analytics, or hidden trackers.  
- Everything happens right on your iPhone or iPad.  

---

### 📱 What's Stored on Your Device
If you add it, it stays local — simple as that:
- Contact details (names, birthdays, family info, addresses, social links)  
- Notes you choose to add  
- Your app preferences (themes, colors, view modes)  

💡 **iCloud Sync**  
Forgetze uses iCloud to automatically sync your contacts across all your devices. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and only you can access it. We never see or control your data - it's yours.

### 🚫 What We Never Do
- ❌ Collect personal data  
- ❌ Send data to servers  
- ❌ Track you with analytics  
- ❌ Share or sell data  

We can't access your data — even if we wanted to. It's yours.

### 🎙 App Permissions (and Why)
- **Microphone** → To let you use voice search (processed on your device)  
- **Speech Recognition** → To turn your speech into text for searching contacts  
- **Contacts (optional)** → Only if you choose to export to iOS Contacts

### 🗑 Data Retention & Control
- Your data stays until you delete it.  
- Edit or remove anything whenever you want.

- If you've enabled iCloud, Apple's iCloud policies apply.

### 🛡 Security
